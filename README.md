# Plotify Pairing Workspace

This is a empty shell repo with the following pre-installed:

* typescript
* jest
* ts-node

When preparing for for the Pairing exercise, you can clone this repo and use it as your workspace. You can add additional modules as you please or create one completely from scratch. The important thing is to do what makes you feel most comfortable.

*NOTE* Pairing exercises will not involve html or any ui framework. All code will be executed on the terminal.

Wish you the best.
